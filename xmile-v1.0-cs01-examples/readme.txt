Files in this directory fall into two categories.

Some files are intended to illustrate complete models, and will have content that represents 
a realistic model and can be simulated to produce meaningful results.

Other files are intended to test specific features in the schema and may contain 
simplistic or partial formulations. They may illustrate such features and/or
be later migrated into a more formal test suite.

ll models in this directory should validate correctly against the schema.
